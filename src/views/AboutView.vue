          <p class="mt-5">
            Coffreka Coffee opened over 19 years ago, in 2003, when JD and Kathy
            Merget moved from their tiny Chinatown apartment to start a small
            coffee business in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. At the time they simply
            wanted to serve neighborhood locals the best coffee the area had to
            offer. Since then Coffreka has grown to be a place JD and Kathy
            could only have dreamed of, evolving to become a respected
            establishment with a name that is synonymous with the best coffee in
            New York City - their own coffee, roasted in their trusty
            small-batch Probat roaster as Coffreka Coffee Roasters.

            roasting it, and thatâ€™s saying something.

            Our mission is to offer a positive experience for all involved: the
            best coffee for our customers; the best work environment, training
            and support for our staff; support for our fellow local businesses
            by utilizing their products; and participating in and donating to
            local causes.

            Our premium coffee beans come from farmers who use ecologically and
            socially sustainable practices, helping to support a healthy
            ecosystem and to provide a fair living for their workers. These are
            the only farms that can produce the high quality coffee we use. The
            care that goes into growing, shipping and finally roasting these
            coffees is reflected in the flavor of the finished product.
